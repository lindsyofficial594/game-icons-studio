## What is this?

If you keep a folder of game shortcuts on Windows, they usually show plain, mismatched icons. **Game Icons Studio** scans that folder, finds the right cover art for each game, builds clean Windows icons, and applies them automatically — turning a messy folder into a tidy game shelf.

It runs entirely on your PC. The interface opens in your web browser, but it is **not** a website — it is a local tool, and nothing is uploaded anywhere.

## Features

- 🎮 **Automatic matching** — finds the right game on SteamGridDB for each shortcut
- 🖼️ **High-quality icons** — downloads square cover art and builds crisp multi-size `.ico` files
- ✅ **You stay in control** — review every cover, change the ones you don't like, or accept all automatically
- 🎨 **7 themes**, fullscreen, zoom, and keyboard navigation
- 🔁 **Quick re-apply** and a searchable **history** of your changes
- 🧰 **Repair icon cache** for when Windows shows blank or stale icons
- 🆕 **New-game detection** — only processes games you've added since last time

## Requirements

- **Windows 10 or 11**
- **PowerShell 7+** (recommended) — [get it here](https://aka.ms/powershell)
- A **free SteamGridDB API key** (the app walks you through getting one on first run)

## How to use

1. **[Download the latest release](https://github.com/YellowRed1705/game-icons-studio/releases/latest)** (the `.zip` file).
2. **Right-click the `.zip` → Properties → check "Unblock" → OK**, then extract it anywhere.
3. Open the folder and double-click **`Game Icons Studio.bat`**.
4. On first run, follow the on-screen steps to paste your free SteamGridDB API key.
5. Choose your game shortcuts folder and let it work. Review the covers, then apply.

## Is it safe?

Yes — and it's open source so you can read exactly what it does.

- It **only changes the icon** of a shortcut. Nothing is deleted; your shortcuts keep working exactly as before.
- It runs **100% locally**. Your API key and your files never leave your PC. The only internet connection is to SteamGridDB, to fetch cover art.
- Because it's a PowerShell tool, Windows SmartScreen or your antivirus may show a caution prompt the first time. That's normal for unsigned scripts — the source here is fully open for inspection.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Applying icons is currently **not reversible from within the app** (there is no built-in undo/restore). Use the "Change specific icons" option if you want to redo individual ones.

## FAQ

**Does this work with Steam / Epic / GOG games?**
It works with any Windows shortcut (`.lnk`). If you have a folder of shortcuts to your games (from any launcher), it works. It also offers to convert `.url` launcher shortcuts to `.lnk` so their icons can be customized.

**Does it change my actual games or library?**
No. It only changes the icon shown on the shortcut file. Your games and launchers are untouched.

**Do I have to pay for the SteamGridDB API key?**
No, it's completely free. You create a SteamGridDB account (sign in with Steam) and generate a key — the app links you straight to it.

**Why does it open in my browser?**
The browser is just the app's window. It's served from your own PC on localhost; there's no website and no data leaves your machine.
